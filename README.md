# To-do List


- A to-do list project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. The project typically involves creating an input field where users can enter their tasks, and a button to add the task to the list. Each task is displayed as a list item, along with a button to delete the task.

- The project also includes features like marking a task as completed or in progress, sorting tasks by priority or due date, and saving the task list to local storage so that it persists even after the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.

- Additionally, it can be customized and expanded upon to add more features and functionality.
